# Attest On-Chain Verification Web2 Frontend

This is the frontend to prove ownership of Web2 Identities in a decentralized way. Verification can be checked on-chain via smart contract [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd182C5BaD241be139128a12853Af857aB450df2F).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Note
This is a companion web app in a suite of two: this app is used to prove ownership of off-chain identities, and then the verification step happens *on-chain*. We have a demo of this in a simple dApp [here](https://github.com/osilverstein/ethsf-midpointFrontend).
